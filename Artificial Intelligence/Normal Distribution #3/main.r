# A large group of students took a test in physics and the final grades have a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 10. If we can approximate the distribution of these grades by a normal distribution, what percent of the students
# a) scored higher than 80?
# b) should pass the test (gradesâ‰¥60)?
# c) should fail the test (grades<60)?
